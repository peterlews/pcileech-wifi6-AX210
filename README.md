# AX210 Emulated Firmware

## Legal Devices Emulated
- 1:1 configuration space with IP core
- Driver support
- Full BAR support
- Response in TLP regarding non-uniform memory alignment
- TLPs error checking
## Caution Against Scammers
Currently, there are many fake users cloning this open-source library and using our information to deceive others. 

## ⚠️ About TLP Interrupts

The TLP interrupt mechanism requires proper echoing with the computer motherboard. This project was developed specifically for **ASUS motherboards**, ensuring compatibility. However, many individuals who have **stolen this project** fail to adapt the kernel interrupts for other systems. As a result, users might experience issues such as **blue screens** or other errors due to these unaddressed compatibility problems. These individuals often mislead users into switching to specific motherboards instead of resolving the underlying issues, highlighting their lack of technical expertise.

While **network card firmware technology is outdated**, some developers continue to sell it at **high prices**, exploiting users who may not know better. Our decision to open-source this technology has disrupted many fraudulent developers, leading to retaliation instead of constructive improvements on their part. We believe that true developers should focus on **learning, innovating**, and solving compatibility challenges rather than deceiving customers or charging unreasonable fees.
  
## ⚠️ Important Update on Network Card Firmware

ACE has now marked all **Intel** and **Realtek** series network cards. In the future, **network card firmware** will be fully detected. Scammers who are exploiting our open-source technology will soon be exposed.

### Why We Open-Sourced This Project
The primary purpose of open-sourcing this project was to **counter the exploitation of our work**. By making the technology publicly available, we ensure that **malicious users** cannot hide behind our creations and resell them unlawfully.

We will continue to monitor and update the firmware to stay ahead of these attempts.

Thank you for your continued support.

### Open Access to Network Card DMA Firmware
ACE has recently restricted many RTL-type devices, including network card DMA firmware. Importantly, this technology has become **publicly accessible**, allowing anyone with basic technical knowledge to quickly learn and create it. As a result, prices for these firmware solutions remain relatively affordable, generally within the **100-180 USD** range. This applies to both Killer cards and other models, so prices should not vary significantly.


### Recognizing False Claims and High-Price Tactics
Some individuals may attempt to mislead new players by claiming that open-source network card devices, often with additional modifications, are exclusive "internal" products. They may also assert that their versions are unique or private. 

However:
- **Unique Firmware:** ACE is likely to soon gather data on all such devices. Each firmware version requires unique encoding, ensuring distinct versions for each user.
- **Open and Accessible Technology:** With the right emulation skills, anyone can achieve stability and reliability in these devices. There is no "private" firmware—only **thousands of lines of code** accessible to those who seek it.

### Scam Alert
If you’ve paid **300 USD** for network card emulation firmware, there’s a strong chance you’ve been overcharged, as this technology is now widely accessible.
